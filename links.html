<blockquote>
    <p>Urban coyotes are being researched and tracked by several organizations in multiple major U.S. cities. Here's a list of some of the sites that I found most interesting when I was doing research on this topic back in 2013.</p>

    <a href="http://www.portlandcoyote.com/">Portland Urban Coyote Project</a>
    <p>This website is a project sponsored by Portland State University and the Audubon Society. "Citizen Scientists" can report sightings to help in the efforts of researching this subject.</p><br>
    
    <a href="http://www.urbancoyoteproject.com/blog/2015/4/05/10-fascinating-facts-about-urban-coyotes">Urban Coyote Project</a>
    <p>This site is a wealth of informatiion and other resourses. It was founded by photojournalist Jaymi Heimbuch and features a great gallery, newsletter and blog. The site is run primarily by grants, but they do accept tax-deductible contributions as well.</p><br>
    
    <a href="http://www.projectcoyote.org/">Project Coyote</a>
    <p>This is a project of the Earth Island Institute which is "a non-profit, public interest, membership organization that supports people who are creating solutions to protect our shared planet." They also have sites about other carnivores including bears, mountain lions and bobcats.</p><br>

    <figcaption>I started researching Urban Coyotes in late 2013 when one of our cats, Zella, slipped out while someone was leaving our home in the early evening. We found blood and part of what looked like maybe a feline nail or toe in our driveway later in the week. A month later, a neighbor came to our door with Zella's collar and told us where to find her remains (which at that point was just her head and one leg). Iâ€™m dedicating this website project to her memory. &nbsp; R.I.P. little Z.</figcaption>
